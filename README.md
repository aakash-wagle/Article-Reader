# Article-Reader

A python program that reads text files and web articles, equipped with a GUI.

To run the program on your system:
1. Download the repo and open the entire folder in your IDE/editor.
2. Run the ‘ARGUI.py’ file, not the ‘ArticleReader.py’ file.
3. Running ‘ArticleReader.py’ would not generate a GUI.
