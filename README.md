# Article-Reader

A python program that reads text files and web articles, equipped with a GUI.

To run the program on your system:

2. Make sure the following modules are installed:
    1. pyttsx3
    2. selenium
    3. bs4
    4. requests

4. Run the ‘ARGUI.py’ file, not the ‘ArticleReader.py’ file.
5. Running ‘ArticleReader.py’ would not generate a GUI.
